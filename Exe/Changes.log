For known issues and intended additions see the bottom of this file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.8 : 20121106
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're now on GitHub!

Inventory dialog:
* Added option to limit the number of rows the auto-selection performs if you have a cube.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.7 : 20111225
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed the name of "Abyssal Mines" in Zones.ini : All subzones have now been fixed and confirmed to be spelled correctly!
* Added option to block out logging of "double XP" monsters such as spawn during festivus. Since these can spawn in all areas and may disrupt data integrity.

Data analysis dialog (F9):
* Added ability to completely hide certain rows based on kill count.
* The dialog should now save it's settings more reliably.
* The level column now sorts by it's first number rather than by text. So, it will sort as: 1,2,3,4,5,6 instead of 1,20,3,50+,7 etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.6 : 2011118
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed the name of "Fork Tongue Clutch" in Zones.ini
* Fixed Alt+F4 to close application.
* Added "Lazy Zoneview" option. This ensures the zone view is never cleared automatically. To combat a so far unknown issue some people were having.
* Added ability to pre-fill your username and password. Note: These are stored locally in DragonLogger.ini as plain text. So, only use this feature if your pc is 100% secure.
* Added data export to .csv file format. See Menu: Browser -> Export. The exported data is controlled by your other preferences (such as include host data)
* Added option to preferences(F11) to export .csv data as total kill count(default) or percentages(as seen in the analyze dialog).

Inventory dialog:
* Added progress dialog upon cubing more than two items. To show it is working hard on making your items into gold.
* Sort columns are now remembered on open/close.
* Position on screen and width/height are now remembered on open/close.

Data analysis dialog (F9):
* Dialog is no longer modal. Meaning you can keep it open while exploring, and press the new refresh button to update the data.
* Sort columns are now remembered on open/close.
* Position on screen and width/height are now remembered on open/close.
* Now has a smaller "minimum" size.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.5 : 20111024
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed the names of "Temple of Filth", "The Sandy Beggar" and "Den of the Delvisha" in Zones.ini - hope that's the last of them, but can't be 100% sure just yet.
* Data analysis dialog(F9) added. You'll be able to find detailed % of which zones have the highest population to hunt.
* Added background color preferences(F11) for the data analyzer. Fixed colors for now, but you can change the activation %.
* Inventory list by default now sorts the value/weight column instead of the weight column.
* Main window tables and Inventory dialog table changed to "read only" - doesn't affect anything but it looked silly if you tried to double click it.
* Added lots more icons. Once again thanks to the FatCow free Farm-fresh set. http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.4 : 20111015
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed the names of "Planar Crossroads" and "Sliverghoul Burrow" in Zones.ini.
* Inventory list dialog is now sortable.
* Implemented alternating row colors for all tables.
* Collected data is now stored separately from the developer data. You will never have to worry about losing your data after upgrading again!
* Added preferences dialog (F11). Currently you are able to hide the developer collected data, and show/hide the combined data columns.
* Added hotkey for help dialog (F1) and about dialog (F2).

Main screen:
* Gathered data method changed to "table views" to support host/local data.
* The table row indication for new creatures found during this exploration attempt will now draw in a "bold" style instead of show "(+1)".
* Zoneview and Dataview tables are now sortable! - Current sort column and direction will be remembered in the settings.
* Made the screen slightly less wide. (Around 40-50 pixels or so)
* Added ability to hide the browser navigation bar. You can find the option in the preferences dialog (F11).
* Added ability to manually refresh the data view with the push of a single button.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.0.3 : 20110925
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed browser window losing focus after closing the Inventory list dialog, or pressing certain action buttons. It should be a bit less "strange" to use now.
* Disabled buttons when logged out or timed out.
* More button icons added.
* Buttons are now double buffered - which stops the strange icon fade-in / fade-out after selection on Vista and Windows 7.
* Added several button tooltips.
* Menubar added, to fit in a lot more actions and shortcuts for the future.
* Hotkeys dialog added. It shows you all the known DT hotkeys and how to enable them.
* Page source dialog: Added select all ability (Ctrl+A), as well as Escape button to close.
* Dialog creation changed to runtime rather than global. (You shouldn't notice much other than a slightly smaller memory footprint)
* Subdialog default positions changed to "Owner Form Center". So, no more random positions on those.
* We are now hiding several "strange" urls like google syndication, facebook, blanc, javascript e.a. that were reported earlier. Remember this is a Dragon Tavern logger, so while other webpages might work - it is not the main focus of this application. As a result of hiding these urls, the buttons and menu actions should be enabled/disabled in a more reliable & predictable manner.
* Disabled "Return to tavern", if you are in the tavern. It isn't going to do you much good to go where you already are.
* Added the list of monsters found in the tavern.
* Now keeping track of the latest version of the application you started. So we can show a changelog on startup later.

Inventory dialog:
* Added "select common" button.
* Changed select weight in to work as "this weight and greater".
* OK button renamed to: "Portal It!"
* Turned warning text red.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added application icon

Main screen:
* Button tab order improved.
* Added "about" dialog. (Questionmark button topright)
* Added some icons. It's not much, but looks better at least.
* Page source button. Mostly for debugging purposes.
* Inventory list button now has a better placement among it's fellows.
* Inventory list button is now disabled properly.
* Inventory list button can now be pressed even when you are not on your inventory page. It will try to load your inventory, "and then" open the dialog.

Inventory dialog:
* Button tab order improved.
* Added 5 new buttons - Select all by weight: 10, 11, 12, 13, unselect all.
* It will now tell you how many items you have selected.
* Implemented number of cube charges available.
* Show a warning if you select more items than the available cube charges.
* No longer tries to recycle selected items if you do not have a cube.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intended additions : (At an unknown point in the future, stay tuned for updates!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:
* List of titles earned / still unearned + how to get them. : see http://dragontavern.wikia.com/wiki/Titles
	* Expand titles list file with the help of the forum community first.
* Add subzone exploration attempt counter.
* Add dialog to export, so you can choose which data to export and whether to export raw data, or percentages.
* Keep track of the creature type you are currently hunting.
* Log your biggest haul.
* Log the most expensive item ever sold.
* Log boss kills
* Recent events log ( Killed X, killed Y, looted X, avoided trap, much like the front page )
* Auto-explore. Explore automatically until a certain criteria is met.
** X wounds taken, X explores done, run out of AP (duh), inventory is >= X%, you level up, you reach level X, you encounter a sublocation
** Give result of the auto explore. You found X gold, Y gold worth in items, slain Z monsters, and died on the X'th exploration attempt. Or "are still alive".

User Interface:
* Expand the Preferences dialog to allow some customization of the interface. (In progress)
* Show / Hide menu bar & side bar. And remember whether the bar was visible on startup.
* Add multiple export styles: Html / xml / tabbed.txt
* Add option to show % values to data table.
* Restore selection and vertical scroll position after a manual refresh to the data analysis dialog.
* Optionally remember last used row for Dataview combobox.
* Make the delay between cubings a preference. Current default 500 ms, allow it to be a setting between 300ms - 5000ms.
* Show a changelog dialog (once) if we detect the user has updated the application. Should be possible to enable this in the preferences.
* Option to only show subzones in the Dataview combobox if you are in a zone. (All zones if you are in DT)
* Method for increasing/decreasing the browser font size / zoom level.
* Make "referrer ID" an ini option, which defaults to shadow-bolts, so you can change it and use the program to recruit "your" friends.
* Compressed view for the statistics page, showing only the "best 2" columns instead of 1 of each type.
* Hide Levels Above / below X, in data analysis view
* Have the select all X in the inventory manager only select the lowest Y items, where Y is the max number of current cube charges
* Add a "hide beer dragon realm" in the options

Under the hood:
* Threaded data refreshing, so as not to interfere with page reloads.
* Optimizations in the search pattern. Regex?
* Better blocking of javascripts that cause full page reloads.
* Check time since last action. (up to 1 hour?) to keep track of whether we are still logged on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Odd stuff that is not a bug
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* After logging out / timing out and reaching the login page, the login button (alt+L) wil appear misformed and small.
** This is a bug in IE / Dragon Tavern itself and will occur when running IE normally as well.
